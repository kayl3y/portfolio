<h1> Robots! </h1>
<h2> What do I think about robots? </h2>
<p> My idea of robotics has changed because I always thought that robots would make life easier. They were all made with an intended purpose and I assumed all those purposes and good intentions. I am excited for the future of robots because I know they will do some good. From doing common household chores to being able to live independently with the use of a robot, it will make life easier. It makes me nervous beause robotics has so much power and the idea of that power falling into the hands of someone who might abuse it is frightening. I am also nervous for the economy because robots would be able to put so many of the working-classAmericans out of jobs, affecting our economy by raising the percent of unemployment.</p>
